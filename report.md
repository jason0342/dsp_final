# Digital Speech Processing Final Project Report
Topic: Deep Speech 2 and A Simplified Adaption to the Homework 2 Recognition Task  
Auther: B03901052 王傑生  
Instructor: Prof. Lin-shan Lee

#### I. Introduction

#### II. Model and Techniques

#### III. Performance

#### IV. Adaption to the Homework 2 Recognition Task
Since directly reproducing the result in the paper, which trained an entire end-to-end recognition model for a language with tens of millions of parameters, would require tremendous computational resources and time, in the project, a simplified version of the model for the homework 2 Chinese digit recognition task is trained, tested and compared to the result of the HMM model in homework 2.

#### V. Result and Discussion
